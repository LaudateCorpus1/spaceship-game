## What to do now

Now we want to create the creatures

- Create a `Creature` class
- Like before, create a constructor which creates and appends an alien (`src/static/Creature.svg`).
  - The creature should be created to the right of the screen (`right:0`)
  - Use `Math.random` to randomnly determine where the creature will appear on the y-axis

## Requirements

- Clone/Download this repository and use this branch

## Usage

Open `index.html` in the modern browser of your choosing from the downloaded/cloned repository.
