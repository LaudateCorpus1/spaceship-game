# Start of the Spaceship Game
Welcome! This is the starting point. This workshop will set you on the right path to make a spaceship game in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. At the end of it,
your game should look something like this:

... without the lives, scoring and aliens shooting lasers back at you ;). Those would be next steps if you want to continue making and optimizing this game.

## What to do
- Follow the installations steps below
- Create a `Ship` class with default attributes in a constructor
- Create the spaceship in the DOM (we give you an image of the ship: `src/static/Spaceship.svg`), either directly in the HTML
or in your constructor. 
  - Your ship should be all the way to the left.
- Instantiate an instance of your `Ship`
- Make sure when you run the game, your ship is there and is at 0 on the x-axis (all the way to the left)

## Requirements
- Node LTS (https://nodejs.org/)

## Usage
### Install dependencies (only once)
```
npm install
```

### Run the game (whenever you want to run it)
```
npm run start
```
To stop the run, use `CTRL + C` or `CMD + C`
