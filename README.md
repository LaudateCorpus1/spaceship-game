# Our creatures move. They have collision. They can explode on contact.
Alright, we're pretty much at the finish line! We want them to spawn randomnly now at different speeds.

This next one isn't as clear due to how this branch was made with the creature showing up immediately, but you get the point.

## Requirements
- Node LTS (https://nodejs.org/)

## What to do now
Almost done! We just want the creatures to spawn at random intervals now (`setInterval` and `Math.random`). You can also take the time to make our ship lose lives on contact or when the creatures get to the edge of the screen without dying.

## Usage
### Install dependencies (only once)
```
npm install
```

### Run the game (whenever you want to run it)
```
npm run start
```
To stop the run, use `CTRL + C` or `CMD + C`
